# Open Source Cartridge Dataset

A community-maintained dataset of ammunition cartridge information for use by developers, engineers, data scientists, and anyone who might find it useful.

# Status

This project is a **work-in-progress**. To date, only the names of SAAMI and C.I.P cartridges are listed in the dataset.

**Contributions are very welcome, and encouraged!**


# Installation

## [NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cartridges)

```
npm install cartridges
```

## Python

**Coming soon**


# Usage

## NodeJS

```
const cartridges = require('cartridges');

console.log('Rimfire cartridge names:', cartridges.names.rimfire);
console.log('Cartridge details:', cartridges.rimfire.saami['22 Long']);
```

## Python

**Coming soon**


# Overview

## Categories


Cartridges have a **lot** of variation, which presents some challenges for accurate and maintainable categorization. For the sake of simplicity, we use the following as top-level categories:

* Pistol
* Rifle
* Rimfire
* Shotshell

They aren't perfect, but most cartridges should be immediately recognizable as one of these. We've gotta start somewhere.


## Structure

For each category above, there is a section within the top-level `cartridges.json` file listing cartridge names, as well as a directory containing separate JSON files for cartridges defined by each standardization body (e.g. `saami.json`). These separate JSON files will contain relevant information about the cartridges, according to the format below.


## Format

**Work In Progress**

The following template should be used when adding a cartridge to the dataset. This template may evolve over time and backward-compatibility should be maintained to the best of our abilities. Language-specific packages based off of this dataset should use semantic versioning to ensure that format changes don't break userspace.


### Units of measure

Cartridges are often defined in both the Metric and Imperial units of measure. In order to provide maximum flexibility, **both units must be provided** in the specification file.

```
{
  "name": "<official cartridge name>",
  "names": [
    "<other names for this cartridge>"
  ],
  "diameter_mm": "<bullet diameter in millimeters>",
  "diameter_in": "<bullet diameter in inches>",
  "specs": {
    "coal_mm": "<cartridge overall length in millimeters>",
    "coal_in": "<cartridge overall length in inches>",
    "bullet": {},
    "case": {},
    "primer": {}
  },
  "standard": "<name of body/org who maintains the spec (e.g.: SAAMI, NATO, CIP, proprietary)>",
  "references": [
    "<urls to the sources of the information provided here>"
  ]
}
```
